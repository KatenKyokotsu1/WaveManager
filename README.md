# WaveManager
WaveManager is a modular and data-driven spawning system built in Unity. It manages dynamic object spawning within customizable ring-shaped areas, supporting difficulty scaling, layer filtering, and physics-based terrain adaptation. Ideal for procedural enemy waves, resource generation, and event-driven world systems in 3D games.
